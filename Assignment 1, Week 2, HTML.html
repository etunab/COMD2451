<h1>My college life</h1>
<body>
    
    <p style="background-color: aquamarine;">
        <i>This is my third year in college, and it has been an amazing journey for me as a foreigner from Georgia.
    The learning structure in the United States is different from what I was used to, and I like it a lot.
    The most important thing that I appriciate about college here is that it gives students opportunity to
    explore other things and gain experience in fields they're interested in by offering internships.
        I started learning grapgic design two years ago and so far,
        I had my first official internship through Brooklyn Navy Yard program. 
        I also did some design work for several designers, such as creating 
        technical sketches for them, and I created a press kit for a fashion magazine.
         It is becoming more and more evident to me that I am interested in fashion as well. 
         My biggest goal is to work as a graphhic designer and model for my favorite high fashion brands 
         such as Prada, Balenciaga and Gucci.</p>
    <p> I believe that with these fast steps and great support from college, me and other students are capable of
        achieving their goals in their fields of interest. And finally my favorite quote of all time is:
    <q>You never know what you can do until you try, and very few try unless they have to
        <!-- ps:only you can make your life beautiful -->
